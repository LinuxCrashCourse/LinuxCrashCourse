# gcc/g++

## Notes

gcc and g++ are functionally the same the difference is gcc is for C and g++ is
for C++.

## Optimizing

- -O0 This is the default. this has the fastest compile time and is bent for
  debuging
- -O1 Optimize This turns on basic optimizations
- -O2 Optimize even more. This turns on nearly all supported optimizations that
  that gcc has.
- -O3 Optimize yet more. This turns on all optimizations and can cause problems.

## Debugging

- -g This is the Debugging flag to use [gdb/cgdb](./gdb-cgdb.md)
